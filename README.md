# Heart Failure Prediction

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart failure using clinical data, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions.

## Description
This project predicts the likelihood of heart failure based on clinical data. It uses machine learning models trained on a dataset of patient records to identify key indicators of heart disease and assess risk levels. The project is designed to aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Features
- Analysis of clinical features affecting heart failure.
- Visualization of key metrics and correlations.
- Implementation of machine learning models for prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is located in the `dataset` folder:
- `heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv`: Contains patient records with clinical features and heart failure outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Heart_Failure_Prediction-main
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
   ```
   > If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install the libraries manually using `pip install`.
